# mpLBFGS

**mpLBFGS** is a header-only C++ library that implements the Polak-Ribi√®re
conjugate gradient descent and the limited-memory BFGS algorithm (L-BFGS) for unconstrained optimization. The library uses multiple precision scalars instead of the default double machine precision. This allows to obtain much more accurate approximations of the minimizers, effectively to arbitrary precision.

# Build instructions and dependencies

You can either take the provided Makefile as an example, or use cmake like so:

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`

The library itself is header only; however, it requires **Eigen** for matrix
computations and **mpfr** for multiple precision floating point scalars. You
will need **gmp** and **mpfr** installed on your system in order to use the multiple precision scalars. The optimizers are templatized in the scalar type, so falling back to the double precision is a search-and-replace away.
You can get the C++ mpfr wrapper and Eigen by running `make getmpfr` and `make geteigen` respectively.

and implementation goes back to Jorge Nocedal and his collaborators.  The multiple precision numbers are provided by the [GNU MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/), wrapped in `mpreal` class by [Pavel Holoborodko](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/).
